# UniofBath coursework archive

Collection of coursework, reports, and small code exercises from the University of Bath Physics degree. Most items are static PDFs; code is kept as lightweight scripts.

## Folder guide
- `C/` — C programming exercises with accompanying PDFs.
- `Exoplanets/` — astrophysics coursework with a Jupyter notebook, figures, and `requirements.txt`; see `Exoplanets/README.md` for setup.
- `Lab Reports/` — submitted lab reports (PDF).
- `MATLAB/` — `.m` scripts and briefs for MATLAB assignments.
- `Malvern Panalytical/` — final year project report.
- `Python/` — small physics simulations/plots written in Python.

## Working with the code
- Python: create a virtual environment and install any listed requirements (e.g., `pip install -r Exoplanets/requirements.txt`) before opening notebooks or scripts.
- MATLAB: open `.m` files directly in MATLAB/Octave.
- PDFs are reference only; avoid redistributing material that is subject to academic integrity rules.
